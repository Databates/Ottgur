*DAY 1 RETROSPECTIVES

**Devin

Immediately after choosing to do an image upload app, I felt fairly overwhelmed. But after we started talking about what our MVP would include and sketching the schema I started to get a grasp of what we needed to do. I appreciated how we found a quiet place to do some planning before breaking into pairs, and think we set a good precedent by sticking with our afternoon meeting a few hours later. I know it’ll get tougher to hold to our schedule if pressure mounts, but I really think we benefit from touching base in some form… Overall, I’m not thinking our process requires any major adjustments. Let’s keep it going!
